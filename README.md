# final-dix-sept-erledigt
2017 Final Team Project

Check the wiki for details and team pages.

Our project is a picture game thing, similar to a personality
quiz. Here are some of the components of our project:

1. A set of questions to discover what "picture" or "meme" best describes you based on your responses
2. Creating an array list full of pictures to use for the quiz
3. A set of 10-15 questions in the quiz
4. Lots of if and for loops

Question ideas:
1. Favorite color
2. Favorite animal
3. Favorite food
4. Favorite school subject
5. Favorite game
6. Favorite book
7. Favorite movie
8. Fav ice cream flavor
9. Favorite java method?? (for, if, while)
10. Favorite sport

There will be maybe 4 options per question? Or, to make it complex, we could have the person taking the quiz to just
type their answer which will let us have some "if" statements that are prepared, and if they input something out of the norm,
we can automatically set up a response. 

Picture ideas(do we incorporate vines?):
-Kermit the frog (tea and hood one)
-Arthur's fist
-Spongebob (Mr. Krabs one)
-Spongebob (tHe oNe THaT Is LiKe tHis)
-Hurricane Tortilla
-Avocado...Thanks
-Ms. Keisha?

*DO WE ONLY NEED 4 MEME OPTIONS IF THERE ARE ONLY 4 OPTIONS PER QUESTION?*
